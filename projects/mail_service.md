# Mail Service

We have a simple system called mailo, which helps us store user data from different events, with their names, emails and which events they attended.

This system requires a mail service to send emails to users, but ITU's own mailing service only lets us send only 200 emails per day.

Using a provider like Gmail also fails because sending mass emails at the same time is seen as spam.

We need to figure out a new provider, or a way to create our own system to send our emails.

If there is a generic limit to send emails in every provider, like so if you need to send more than 1000, you send 300 every hour or day, we need to figure this out.

This project is not decided how to be implemented yet, so the tech stack is not finalized.
