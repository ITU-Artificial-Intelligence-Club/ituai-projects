## Project Description

This project is not going to start from scratch but rather will be an addition to the current Cez project.

### Additions and Changes

#### Frontend

Canvas rendering is a bit messy, it needs to be refactored and cleaned up.

#### Backend

Currently there is only AI for Cez on the backend. We need to create a continuous websocket connection for the game, where users will be able to:
- Create a game
- Join a game
- Watch a game - would be cool

And do some certain actions while playing the game.

Websocket communication needs to be implemented with FastAPI.

## Project Plan

0. Play and learn Cez ‚ôüÔ∏è
1. Figure out how to establish WebSocket (WS) connections between two players üîå
    - Test out the WS connection with dummy data
2. Add ability to create rooms/matches. People should be able to join either by code or by link
3. Implement serialization/deserialization for Cez game state (?)
    - The game should render the new state when it's recieved
    - Are there any security concerns? Hacks, open to exploits?
4. Implement player roles, which person plays black/white
    - E.g. if a player who is playing white sends a move for black, it should be discarded
